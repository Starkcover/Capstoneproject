Comprehensive Analysis Report: Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots
Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed analysis of a dynamic pricing system for urban parking lots developed as part of the Summer Analytics 2025 capstone project. The implementation includes two sophisticated pricing models built using real-time data processing with Pathway framework, hyperparameter optimization with Optuna, and interactive visualizations with Bokeh. The project successfully addresses the challenge of efficiently pricing 14 parking spaces based on real-time demand, occupancy, and environmental factors

Project Overview and Objectives
Background

The project tackles the critical urban challenge of parking space utilization through dynamic pricing strategies. Traditional static pricing leads to inefficiencies such as overcrowding during peak hours and underutilization during off-peak periods. The solution implements an intelligent, data-driven pricing engine that adjusts prices in real-time based on multiple factors including occupancy rates, queue lengths, traffic conditions, and special events


Key Requirements

    Real-time Processing: Implementation using Pathway framework for streaming data ingestion

Base Price: Starting point of $10 with smooth price variations

Constraint Libraries: Only NumPy, Pandas, and Pathway allowed for model implementation

Visualization: Real-time dashboards using Bokeh for price monitoring

Multiple Models: Progressive complexity from baseline to advanced demand-based pricing
Data Architecture and Processing
Dataset Characteristics

The implementation processes data from 14 urban parking spaces collected over 73 days, with 18 time points per day (8:00 AM to 4:30 PM, 30-minute intervals). The dataset includes:

    Location Information: Latitude and longitude coordinates

    Parking Lot Features: Capacity, occupancy, queue length

    Vehicle Information: Type classification (car, bike, truck)

    Environmental Conditions: Traffic congestion levels, special day indicators

Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline implements several key transformations:

Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing Model
Architecture and Implementation

Model 1 serves as the foundational pricing approach, implementing a linear relationship between occupancy rates and pricing adjustments

 The model formula is:

Price<sub>t+1</sub> = Base Price + α × (Occupancy/Capacity)
Hyperparameter Optimization

The model employs Optuna for systematic hyperparameter tuning, optimizing the α parameter to maximize correlation between occupancy and pricing:

Optimization Results:

    Optimal α: 1.8727 (derived from 100 optimization trials)

    Price Range: Clamped between $5-$20 for realistic bounds

    Correlation: Strong positive correlation between occupancy and price

Performance Characteristics

Model 1 demonstrates several key performance features:

    Simplicity: Easy to interpret and implement

    Stability: Smooth price transitions without erratic fluctuations

    Responsiveness: Direct relationship to occupancy changes

    Baseline Reference: Serves as comparison point for advanced models

Model 2: Advanced Demand-Based Pricing

Sophisticated Demand Function

Model 2 implements a comprehensive demand-based pricing strategy incorporating multiple environmental and operational factors

The demand function is:

Demand = α×(Occupancy/Capacity) + β×QueueLength - γ×TrafficLevel + δ×IsSpecialDay + ε×VehicleTypeWeight
Optimized Parameters

Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, Model 2 achieved the following optimal parameters:

    α (Occupancy Factor): 4.5762

    β (Queue Length Factor): 1.5186

    γ (Traffic Penalty): 3.5736

    δ (Special Day Bonus): 0.0113

    ε (Vehicle Weight Factor): 1.5615

Advanced Pricing Logic

The final pricing formula incorporates normalized demand with bounded constraints:
